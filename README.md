Noqalta constructive grammar
==============================

Noqalta will be a construted langauge. Using mostly nonconcatenative morphology and fusional affixes. Many of the experimental ideas that have proven useful in bal'ukbar will be used again here, plus many new experimental features.

The initial inspiration and motivation drives from the vowel inventory and the idea of using disyllabic roots and patterns composed of tone, affixes and coda consonants.
