As open syllables of the shape CV form the basic elements of meaning, they are referred here as syllable- "body" or "core". The term "coda" therefore may also include the tone of the syllable.  
The term "predicative" is used here only to revere to the word class of that name (described below). "predicate" is used in it's usual meaning.
